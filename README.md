Hi Machine Learners! Here is an overview of our project:

According to the CDC, heart disease is the leading cause of death for most people of most racial and ethnic groups in the United States. A range of conditions that affect the heart can be referred to as heart disease. These include blood vessel diseases such as coronary artery disease, irregular heartbeats (arrhythmias), heart problems you're born with (congenital heart defects), disease of the heart muscle, and heart valve disease. 

In the US, every 33 seconds a person dies from cardiovascular disease, and 1 in 5 deaths in the US are because of heart disease. With alarming statistics like that it is very important for models like ours to exist and to help aid the diagnosis. Our model uses the data from factors like BMI, sex, race, etc to predict the chances that an individual will get heart disease. The dataset used to train this model is from the CDC.

For our project, we use the Indicators of Heart Disease (2022 UPDATE) dataset to train a model that classifies new instances on the heart disease variable. We used input features like BMI, smoking, alcohol consumption, physical health, mental health, sex, age, etc to determine whether or not the individual has had heart disease. This prediction can eventually be used to determine if an individual is at risk. 

To run our .ipynb file, please download the dataset (heart_2020_cleaned.csv in our repository), then change the path variable to the path of the file on your local computer. *Note, the last 2 models we train use Grid Search and SVM which require a substantial amount of time given the size of the dataset. Therefore, these code blocks may take a long time if you run them on your local computer. 

Yours Truly,

The Cardiologists
